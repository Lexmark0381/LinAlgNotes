WRITE HERE WHAT YOU THINK NEEDS TO BE DONE:

- At the end of each chapter, 
we could provide a serie of exercises,
for example those given in class to us...

- Chapter 3 about Gaussian Elimination can definitely be improved.
Maybe we could include also the process of finding the REF 
(reduced row echelon form), which is equivalent to GE...

- Chapter 7 (and maybe also chapter 9) has some parts hard to understand...

- Chapter 9 could be merged with another chapter...
