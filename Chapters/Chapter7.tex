\chapter{Linear Mappings}
\begin{definition}
A mapping $L:\R^m\to\R^n$ is said to be a \textit{linear mapping} (or linear transformation or linear map) if for any $\uv,\vv\in\R^m$ and any scalar $\alpha$
\begin{align*}
L(\uv+\vv) &= L(\uv)+L(\vv) \\
L(\alpha\uv)&= \alpha L(\uv)
\end{align*}
For any matrix $A\in\R^{m,n}$ we can associate with it a linear mapping $L_A$ as
\[
L_A(\uv)=A\uv \hspace{10mm} \forall\uv\in\R^n
\]
where $L_A$ is a linear mapping from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$.\\ \\
In principle, any linear mapping is completely defined by its values on the basis vectors.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Let us consider the linear mapping $L:\R^2\to\R^2$ and basis in $\R^2$ consisting of the following vectors:
\[
\ul{b}_1 = \colvec{2}{1}{1},\hspace{3mm}\ul{b}_2 = \colvec{2}{-1}{2}
\]
Lets assume that $$L\colvec{2}{1}{1} = \colvec{2}{7}{3}$$ and $$L\colvec{2}{-1}{2} = \colvec{2}{0}{1}$$
How do we find $L\colvec{2}{1}{4}$?\\

Since $\ul{b}_1$ and $\ul{b}_2$ form a basis for $\R^2$, the vector $\colvec{2}{1}{4}$ can be represented as a linear combination of basis vectors:
\[
\colvec{2}{1}{4} = \alpha_1\colvec{2}{1}{1} + \alpha_2\colvec{2}{-1}{2}
\]
We first find $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, in this case we have found $\alpha_1=2$ and $\alpha_2=1$.\\ \\
Then, using the first condition to be a linear mapping $$L(\uv+\vv) = L(\uv)+L(\vv)$$ we know that:
\begin{align*}
L\colvec{2}{1}{4} &= L\left( 2\colvec{2}{1}{1}+1\colvec{2}{-1}{2} \right)\\
&= 2L\colvec{2}{1}{1}+L\colvec{2}{-1}{2}\\
&= 2\colvec{2}{7}{3}+\colvec{2}{0}{1}\\
&= \colvec{2}{14}{7}
\end{align*}
\end{example}\\
For any matrix, we can associate with it a \textit{linear mapping}.\\ \\ 
For any linear mapping, we can associate with it a matrix (usually called \textit{transformation matrix}).
\begin{proof}
Consider the linear mapping $L:\R^m\to\R^n$. Consider also the standard basis $B$ consisting of the following vectors $E_i$:
\[
E_1=\colvec{5}{1}{0}{0}{\vdots}{0},E_2=\colvec{5}{0}{1}{0}{\vdots}{0},\dots,E_m=\colvec{5}{0}{0}{0}{\vdots}{1}
\]
where each vector has $m$ components and, generally, all the components of $E_i$ are zero except for the $i^{th}$ component which is one.\\ \\
Let us denote by
\[
A_1=L(E_1),A_2=L(E_2),\dots,A_m=L(E_m)\in\R^n
\]
Now, if we consider arbitrary vector $x\in\R^m$ as a linear combination of the vectors in our basis $B$:
\[
\ul{x}= x_1E_1 + \dots + x_mE_m
\]\\
Let us use the definition of being a linear mapping:
\begin{align*}
L(\ul{x}) &= L(x_1E_1 + \dots + x_mE_m)\\
&= x_1L(E_1)+\dots+x_mL(E_m)\\
&= x_1A_1+\dots+x_mA_m\\
L(\ul{x}) &= A\ul{x}
\end{align*}
where $A$ is a matrix whose columns are $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_m$. We found matrix $A$ associated with the linear mapping $L$.\\ Note that $A \in \R^{n, m}$ and $x \in \R^m$. Note also that $L:\R^m\to\R^n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
Consider the linear mapping:
\[
L\colvec{3}{x_1}{x_2}{x_3} = \colvec{2}{x_1}{x_2} -\text{ projection from $\R^3$ to $\R^2$}
\]	
\end{example}\\
What will be the matrix $A$ associated with $L$? \\ \\
Let us consider:
\begin{align*}
L(E_1) &= L\colvec{3}{1}{0}{0} = \colvec{2}{\textcolor{red}{1}}{\textcolor{red}{0}} = A_1\\
L(E_2) &= L\colvec{3}{0}{1}{0} = \colvec{2}{\textcolor{green}{0}}{\textcolor{green}{1}} = A_2\\
L(E_3) &= L\colvec{3}{0}{0}{1} = \colvec{2}{\textcolor{blue}{0}}{\textcolor{blue}{0}} = A_3\\
\end{align*}
Now we can construct our matrix $A$ using the vectors $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$ as the column vectors of the matrix $A$:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
\textcolor{red}{1} & \textcolor{green}{0} & \textcolor{blue}{0}\\
\textcolor{red}{0} & \textcolor{green}{1} & \textcolor{blue}{0}
\end{pmatrix}
\] \\ \\
$A$ is therefore the matrix associated with the linear mapping $L$ in the particular basis $B$, which in this case is the standard basis for $\R^3$. \\ \\ We can then conclude that $$L(\ul{x}) = A\ul{x}$$ 
$$L\colvec{3}{x_1}{x_2}{x_3} = \begin{pmatrix}
\textcolor{red}{1} & \textcolor{green}{0} & \textcolor{blue}{0}\\
\textcolor{red}{0} & \textcolor{green}{1} & \textcolor{blue}{0}
\end{pmatrix} \cdot \colvec{3}{x_1}{x_2}{x_3} = \colvec{2}{x_1}{x_2}$$
\section{Matrix Associated with Linear Mapping in a Particular Basis}
From now on we will focus primarily on linear mappings $L:V\to V$ (from a space $V$ to the same space $V$).\\ \\
Assume $\ul{b}_1,\dots,\ul{b}_n$ form a basis $B$ for the space $V$, then any vector $\ul{u}\in V$ can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis $B$:
\[
\uv = u_1\ul{b}_1+\dots +u_n\ul{b}_n
\] \\
We can call $\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n}\in\R^n$, the coordinates of $\uv$ with respect to basis $B$.\\ \\
Yes, as we will see later, coordinates of a vector can change depending on the basis in which they are represented! \\ \\
Now, lets consider the same linear mapping $L:V\to V$ and the same basis $B$ seen above.\\ \\ \textit{How does the matrix associated with the linear mapping $L$ look with respect to the basis $B$?}\\ \\
Since $B$ is a basis for the vector space $V$, then we can write: 
\begin{align*}
L(\ul{b}_1) &= c_{11}\ul{b}_1+c_{12}\ul{b}_2+\dots+c_{1n}\ul{b}_n\\
&\hspace{2mm}\vdots\\
L(\ul{b}_n) &= c_{n1}\ul{b}_1+c_{n2}\ul{b}_2+\dots+c_{nn}\ul{b}_n\\
\end{align*}
which basically means that the transformation $L$ is applied to our basis vectors, and the result is a linear combination of the basis vectors. \\ \\
Now, if we take an arbitrary vector $\uv\in V$, we can represent it as a linear combination of our basis vectors $\ul{b}_1$, $\ul{b}_2$, ... , $\ul{b}_n$:
\[
\uv = u_1\ul{b}_1+u_2\ul{b}_2+\dots+u_n\ul{b}_n = \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}u_i\ul{b}_i
\]
then
\begin{align*}
L(\uv) &= L\left( \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}u_i\ul{b}_i\right) = \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}u_i L(\ul{b}_i) = \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}u_i\sum\limits^{n}_{j=1}c_{ij}\ul{b}_j\\
&= \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}\sum\limits^{n}_{j=1}u_ic_{ij}\ul{b}_j = \sum\limits^{n}_{j=1}\ul{b}_j\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}u_ic_{ij}\\
&= \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}c_{i1}u_i\times \ul{b}_1 + \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}c_{i2}u_i\times \ul{b}_2 + \dots + \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}c_{in}u_i\times \ul{b}_n
\end{align*}
Therefore, we get
\[
L(\uv) = \colvec{3}{\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}c_{i1}u_i}{\vdots}{\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}c_{in}u_i} = C^T \ul{u}
\]
On coordinate vectors our linear mapping is represented by $L(\uv)=C^T\uv$ for a given basis $\ul{b}_1,\dots,\ul{b}_n$. Note that $C^T$ is the transformation matrix associated with the linear transformation $L$.
\begin{note}
For a different basis we will have different coordinates of vectors as well as different associated matrix. 
\end{note}
\begin{example}
Consider a linear transformation $L: \R^3 \rightarrow \R^3$ and basis $B$ composed of the following vectors $b_1, b_2, b_3$.\\ \\ Now, assume that:
\begin{align*}
L(b_1) &= b_1 + b_2\\
L(b_2) &= 5\cdot b_1 - b_2 + 3\cdot b_3\\
L(b_3) &= -b_1+4b_2-7b_3\\
\end{align*}
The matrix associated with this linear mapping $L$ with respect to the basis $B$ is:
\[C^T = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 5 & -1\\
1 & -1 & 4\\
0 & 3 & -7
\end{pmatrix} 
\] \\ \\
Now, let us say we have a vector $\ul{u}$ whose coordinates with respect to the basis $B$ are $\colvec{3}{1}{0}{0}$. To obtain $L(\ul{u})$, we can simply multiply $C^T$ by $\ul{u}$:
\[
L\colvec{3}{1}{0}{0} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 5 & -1\\
1 & -1 & 4\\
0 & 3 & -7
\end{pmatrix}\colvec{3}{1}{0}{0} = \colvec{3}{1}{1}{0} = 1\cdot b_1 + 1\cdot b_2+0\cdot b_3
\]
Note that the entries of the vector $\colvec{3}{1}{1}{0}$ represent the coordinates of the transformation of $\ul{u}$, $L(\ul{u})$, with respect to the basis $B$.
\end{example}

\section{Change of Basis (Matrix)}
The matrix representations of linear mappings (transformation matrices) are also determined by the chosen basis. Since it is often desirable to \textit{work with more than one basis} for a vector space, it is of fundamental importance in linear algebra to be able to easily \textit{transform coordinate representations of vectors taken with respect to one basis to their equivalent representations with respect to another basis}. Such a transformation is called a \textit{change of basis} (matrix). \\ \\
Let us first look at how coordinates of vectors change when we change the basis.\\ \\
Assume we have a vector space $V$. Let us also assume we have basis $B$ for $V$ consisting of the vectors $\ul{b}_1, \ul{b}_2, \dots , \ul{b}_n$ and another basis $D = \{ \ul{d}_1, \ul{d}_2, \dots, \ul{d}_n \}$.\\ \\
Consider now a vector $\vv\in V$, and let $\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n}$ be the coordinates of vector $\vv$ with respect to basis $B$:
$$\vv = u_1\ul{b}_1 + \dots + u_n\ul{b}_n = (u_1,\dots,u_n)\cdot\colvec{3}{\ul{b}_1}{\vdots}{\ul{b}_n} = \colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n}^T\colvec{3}{\ul{b}_1}{\vdots}{\ul{b}_n}$$\\
Note that $\vv$ is here represented as linear combination of the vectors that form the basis $B$, and $u_1, \dots u_2$ are the coordinates relative to the basis $B$ (as we said above).\\ \\
And let $\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}$ be the coordinates of $\vv$ with respect to basis $D$:
$$\vv = w_1\ul{d}_1 + \dots +w_n\ul{d}_n = (w_1, \dots ,w_n)\cdot\colvec{3}{\ul{d}_1}{\vdots}{\ul{d}_n} = \colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}^T\colvec{3}{\ul{d}_1}{\vdots}{\ul{d}_n}$$\\ 
Since $B$ is a basis for $V$, we can express each vector of the basis $D$ in terms of $\ul{b}_1,\dots,\ul{b}_n$:
\begin{align*}
\ul{d}_1 &= S_{11}\ul{b}_1+S_{12}\ul{b}_2+\dots +S_{1n}\ul{b}_n\\
&\hspace{2mm}\vdots \\
\ul{d}_n &= S_{n1}\ul{b}_1+S_{n2}\ul{b}_2+\dots +S_{nn}\ul{b}_n
\end{align*}
Our more compactly: $$\colvec{3}{\ul{d}_1}{\vdots}{\ul{d}_n} = S \colvec{3}{\ul{b}_1}{\vdots}{\ul{b}_n}$$
So $\vv$ can be represented as:
$$\vv = \colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n}^T \colvec{3}{\ul{b}_1}{\vdots}{\ul{b}_n} = \colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}^T \colvec{3}{\ul{d}_1}{\vdots}{\ul{d}_n} = \colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}^T S \colvec{3}{\ul{b}_1}{\vdots}{\ul{b}_n}$$
It follows that:
$$\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n}^T = \colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}^T S$$
If we take the transpose (remembering that $(AB)^T=B^TA^T$ and $(A^T)^T = A$) of both sides, we obtain:
$$\underbrace{\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n}}_{N1} = \underbrace{S^T}_{N2}\underbrace{\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}}_{N3}$$ 
\begin{itemize}
\item $N1$: Coordinates of $\vv$ relative to the basis $B$.
\item Matrix $S$ describes the vectors $\ul{d}_1, \dots, \ul{d}_n$ with respect to basis $B = \{ \ul{b}_1, \dots, \ul{b}_n\}$.
\item $N3$: Coordinates of $\vv$ relative to the basis $D$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}
$S^T$ is invertible (i.e. $(S^T)^{-1}$ exists). We expressed $\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n}$ as $S^T\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}$. We could do the same procedure, but exchanging $\ul{b}_1,\dots,\ul{b}_n$ with $\ul{d}_1,\dots,\ul{d}_n$ and we would arrive to:
\[
\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n} = R^T\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n}
\]
Now we have
$$\uv = \colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n} = S^T \colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n} = S^TR^T\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n} \Rightarrow S^TR^T= RS=I$$
and
$$\wv = \colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n} = R^T \colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n} = R^TS^T\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n} \Rightarrow R^TS^T = SR =I$$ \\
It follows that $R^T=(S^T)^{-1}$, so we have found the inverse of $S^T$, which is what we wanted to do. Note also that $R = S^{-1}$. We can also conclude that $\wv = (S^T)^{-1}\uv$.
\end{lemma} \\ \\
Now, consider the linear mapping $L:V\to V$. Assume that $L$ is represented by the \textit{transformation matrix} $A$ with respect to the basis $B = \{ \ul{b}_1,\dots, \ul{b}_n \}$ and by transformation matrix $A'$ relative to the basis $D$ formed by the following vectors $\ul{d}_1,\dots, \ul{d}_n$. Consider a vector $\uv\in V$.\\ \\ Then $L(\ul{u})$ is represented with respected to the basis $B$ as:
\[
L_B(\uv) = A\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n}
\]
And with respect to the basis $D$ as:
\[
L_D(\uv) = A'\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}
\]
We have:
\[
A\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n} = S^TA'\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}
\]\\
We can now use the fact that $\colvec{3}{u_1}{\vdots}{u_n} = S^T\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}$ to conclude:
$$\Rightarrow AS^T\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n} = S^TA'\colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}$$
Since $\wv = \colvec{3}{w_1}{\vdots}{w_n}$ is an ordinary vector: \\
$$\Rightarrow AS^T = S^TA$$
We multiply from the left side by $(S^T)^{-1}$ both sides:
$$(S^T)^{-1}AS^T = (S^T)^{-1}S^TA'$$
$$(S^T)^{-1}AS^T = IA'$$
We know just change the positions:
$$\underbrace{A'}_{N1} = (S^T)^{-1}\cdot \underbrace{A}_{N2} \cdot S^T$$

\begin{itemize}
\item $N1$: Transformation matrix with respect to the basis $\ul{d}_1,\dots,\ul{d}_n$
\item $N2$: Transformation matrix with respect to the basis $\ul{b}_1,\dots,\ul{b}_n$
\end{itemize}
We have just found how the matrix representing a linear mapping changes when we change the basis. In the example above, the transformation matrix changed from $A$ to $A' = (S^T)^{-1}AS^T$, when we changed from the basis $B$ to $D$.\\ \\

\begin{definition}
Assume that $N\in\R^{n,n}$, $N^{-1}$ exists. $A'=N^{-1}AN$ is called similarity transformation.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
Matrices $A'$ and $A$ are called similar matrices, if $\exists N$ such that 
\[
A'=N^{-1}AN
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Assume that linear mapping $L$ is represented with matrix 
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 4\\
2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\]	
With respect to basis $B$:
\[
B = \left\{\ul{b}_1 = \colvec{2}{1}{0}, \hspace{2mm} \ul{b}_2 = \colvec{2}{0}{1}\right\}
\]
Now, consider a new basis $D$:
\[
D = \left\{ \ul{d}_1 = \colvec{2}{1}{1}, \hspace{2mm} \ul{d}_2 = \colvec{2}{1}{-\frac{1}{2}} \right\}
\]
\textit{How is $L$ represented with respect to the basis $D$, or in other words what is the transformation matrix with respect to $D$?}\\ \\
We first represent the vectors in the basis $D$ as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis $B$:
\[
\begin{rightalignedcases}
d_1 = 1\cdot b_1 + 1\cdot b_2\\
d_2 = 1\cdot b_1 - \frac{1}{2}\cdot b_2
\end{rightalignedcases}
\]
Then we need to find $S$, $S^T$ and $(S^T)^{-1}$:

$$\Rightarrow S = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
1 & -\frac{1}{2}
\end{pmatrix} \Rightarrow S^T =\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
1 & -\frac{1}{2}
\end{pmatrix}\\
\Rightarrow (S^T)^{-1} = -\frac{2}{3}\begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2} & -1\\
-1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Then we can find the transformation matrix $A'$ with respect to the new basis $D$ as follows:
$$
A' =  (S^T)^{-1} A S^T = -\frac{2}{3}\begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2} & -1\\
-1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 4\\
2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
1 & -\frac{1}{2}
\end{pmatrix}\\
= \begin{pmatrix}
5 & 0\\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Note that, in the new basis $D$, our linear mapping is represented with a simpler transformation matrix $A'$, which can ease the work when doing calculations.
\end{example}
